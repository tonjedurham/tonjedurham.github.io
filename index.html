      <p><strong>KT Hoops</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Tonje Durham, who was introduced to the game of basketball when he was 3 years old.</p>
      <p>Tonje began playing day and night to perfect his skills. He never had the opportunity to work with a trainer as a kid so he would work on shooting, defense, ball-handling, and finishing tirelessly until he couldn't stand up straight. All of this work lead him to becoming a state champion at his high school, a conference champion in college, and a league champion in the pros. If you aspire to be a pro this is the first step to that future!</p>
      <p>So come down to KT Hoops where we breed champions and you learn how to become a king/queen on and off the court!</p>
